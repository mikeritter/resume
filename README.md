## Website Development and Consulting in Myrtle Beach, SC

I've been building websites since 1997. I picked it up as a hobby when paralysis left me unable to draw and draft. I poured the energy of technical design into code. From the early days of static websites to integrating server-side includes and Flash animations I grew with the technology. I picked up web design again after leaving my career in social services.

Website development offers me the convenience of working from home and with familiar equipment regardless of weather and transportation limitations. Give me a computer and Internet access and I'm good to go!

My core competencies are in experience design and social media intergration. These are how we build a brand. I lead clients through their business goals--often developing a de facto business plan in the  process--and design a strategy to get to that goal. Previous clients include small retailers, churches, authors, and service companies.

As a contractor, I collaborate with the development team to implement the final product. In a climate of rapid development and deployment cycles with testing and versioning across various stages, I recognize the need to work together in the team, communicating openly and responding quickly.

## Technical Experience

My technical know-how ranges from experienced to beginner in today's Web stack.  I'm an academic: focused on making sure things are done correctly, but a team player. My resourcefulness and tenacity prove vital in finding my way through a tough problem. I'll comb through code for standards compliance and test it before launching out (that includes responsiveness).

## Knowlegde, Skills and Abilities

Some days I really feel like I'm jut starting out. Then, I have coffee with a friend or colleague and realize the web developer market is full of technicians and hobbyists just coloring by numbers. Digging beneath the surface reveals a shaky foundation sure to crumble because the developer cut corners. Most of my experience has been in these casual conversations. Some clients passed on because they just wanted a quick fix. I've been in over my head too many times. In it all, I've gained important experience.

### Marketing

When my client has that de facto business plan, they know who they are, what they offer, why they are on the web and how to work their tools. Whether they want to generate leads or just have a passive presence on the web to boost legitimacy, they know what to expect of their product.

### Writing

Most customers aren't looking for feature-length content while they're surfing the web for a place to eat, shop, or worship. I help clients reach their audience with a compelling action statement. If I had a button on this resume, it would say "Let's Talk!" because, if I've done my job, you're curious enough to want to reach out and see if I'm right for your team.

### Social Media

I love showing a client how social media is their best friend on the Internet. I've helped clients use their phone to engage interest on Instagram, FaceBook and Twitter. They just needed some direction. As a web developer, I understand my responsibility is to integrate the disperate information into a cohesive platform. Which leads me to...

### Web Optimization

You thought I was going to say <abbr title="search engine optimization">SEO</abbr> didn't you? Nah. We all know that's chasing your tail. Using Open Web Protocols is how we _really_ make content viewable, digestible, and shareable today! Sure, I'll throw in key phrase optimization and work with the client (or copywriter) to craft the content, but it's about so much more than key words.
